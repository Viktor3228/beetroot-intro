             his happened, indeed to the train in which Mr.Fogg was traveling. About twelve o`clock a troop of ten or twelve
            thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to clear the way with its 
            cow-catcher; but the mass of the animals was to great. The buffaloes marched along with a trnquil gait, uttering now and then
            deafening bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taking a particular direction, nothing can moderate
            and change their course; it is a torrnet of living flesh which no dam could contain.

            The traveleres gazed on this curious spectacle drom the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason of all to be in a
            hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should pleased the buffaloes to get out of the way.

            Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longer no discharge his arsenal of revolvers upin them.

            "What a country!" cried he. 'Mere cattle stop the rains, and go by in procession, just if they were not impeding travel! 
            Partbleu! I ghould like to know if Mr. Fogg forsaw this mishap in his programme! And here`s and ingeneer who doesn`t dare 
            to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!'
